K-means algorithm can be applied to term document matrix to find the possible clusters in the matrix. To find cluster of related terms(terms that
co occur) We considered 4 documents related to 2 mutually exclusive topics ”cricket rules” and ”birds” taken from articles in wikipedia[7] and
checked if we can get the 2 clusters from the corpus.
